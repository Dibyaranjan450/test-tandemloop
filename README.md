# Problem - 1: JavaScript Calculator (Class-based)

This is a simple class-based calculator implemented in JavaScript. It performs basic arithmetic operations like **Addition**, **Subtraction**, **Multiplication**, and **Division**.

- Supported operations:
  - Addition (`add`)
  - Subtraction (`sub`)
  - Multiplication (`multiply`)
  - Division (`divide`)

## Example Usage
const calc1 = new Calculator(8.5, 6.8, 'add');
console.log(calc1.calculate());


# Problem - 2: Odd number generator

This JavaScript program generates **odd numbers** of given number starting from 1.

## Example Usage
generateOddNumbers(8);


# Problem - 3: Generate odd number series

This JavaScript program generates a series of **odd numbers** of given number that depends on whether the input is odd or even.

## Example Usage
generateOddSeries(5);


# Problem - 4: Count Multiples from 1 to 9 in an Array

This JavaScript program counts how many numbers in input array are divisible by 1 to 9, and log the result as a dictionary-like object.

## Example Usage
const input = [1, 2, 8, 9, 12, 46, 76, 82, 15, 20, 30];
countMultiples(input);
